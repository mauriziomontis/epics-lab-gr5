# EPICS LAB Group 5

Laboratory from EPICS Summer School 2024 at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin f√ºr Materialien und Energie GmbH

## Brief Description
In this laboratory, students will develop a control system to measure and control the magnetic field produced by a steerer, a vital component of a linear accelerator. The steerer ensures the particle beam follows the correct trajectory by adjusting the magnetic field, preventing collisions and ensuring precision. The setup includes steerers, a high-current power supply, a teslameter, and a stepper motor. Students will program these devices to automate magnetic field measurements, gaining hands-on experience in control systems, data acquisition, and integrating laboratory instruments, all essential for accelerator physics and engineering.
